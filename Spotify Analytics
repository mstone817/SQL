# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle then I created a table to insert Spotify data into. Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 
#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 
SELECT artist_name as Artist,track_name as Track,avg(popularity) as Popularity,avg(danceability) as Danceability,avg(energy) as Energy
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

#What are the top 5 songs?
SELECT track_name as Track, artist_name as Artist, Popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 5 

#What songs have the highest Danceability and Energy?
SELECT artist_name as Artist, track_name as Track, avg(danceability) as Danceability,avg(energy) as Engery
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
LIMIT 5
